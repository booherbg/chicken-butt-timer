# Hurry Up Chicken Butt Timer

This is a timer for the game what's up chicken butt. We didn't have a battery for the real timer. Let's create a timer that is 60 seconds, and randomly plays one of the sound files throughout the timer. When the audio is done pick another one to play, and when the timer goes off play the singe click sound.

For the UI just a simple webpage with a button to start the timer (but don't show how much time is left). Can play a light click every second to ensure it's working.
